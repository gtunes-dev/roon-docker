# — directories, files, and symlinks. Some vendor kernels (QNAP 5.10 is the
# known case) put a private syscall on that number; it returns EFAULT, glibc
# will not fall back (it only does on ENOSYS), and tar treats EFAULT as fatal.
#
# Detected by extracting a tiny archive with the real tar and looking for
# "Bad address". No syscall numbers or vendor matching. The wrapper lives in
# the container's writable layer, so a restart keeps it; it is a no-op once
# 452 is really fchmodat2. Recreating the container re-probes.
#
# Preload is scoped to tar via PATH so RoonServer never loads it.
# RoonServer/start.sh invokes `tar` unqualified, so self-update is covered too.
